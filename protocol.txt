On the screen we see what the following temperature applied on the participants should be, i.e. temperature of their heat-pain threshold or baseline temperature of 32 degrees of Celsius(control).
The temperature of the thermode is raised to the individual's heat-pain threshold, in any case to a maximum of 50 degrees of Celsius, or left at baseline temperature of 32 degrees of Celsius.
The participants press "spacebar" and after 3s the thermode with the specific temperature is applied on their dorsal left forearm, while they hold a mouse with the right hand.
The thermode is applied for 4s at which time the participants rate their urge to move their forearm away from the thermode.
The temperature of the thermode goes down at baseline.
